## Rekog Photo Anonymiser
Photo facial anonymiser using AWS Rekognition. to identify and obscure faces within a photograph.

## Purpose
I had the intent to detect faces in a photo using my existing knowledge of Keras/tensorflow
Then I discovered that AWS provides this as a service in Rekognition.

This project provides a Lambda function to query Rekognition and use the results to obscure the photo data in the identified regions.

The minisite folder contains a simple UI and some public domain images for testing.

My first attempt at this was packaged with Virtualenv, but AWS lambda's don't like certain python libaries generated by Virtualenv on macs, so this repo includes a Dockerfile to spin up a lambda image for building the Python deployment package instead.

## Code style
Python code compliant to the pep-8 standard.
